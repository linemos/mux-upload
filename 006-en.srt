1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:03,140
In this video so
shall we talk about even and odd numbers,

2
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:05,150
and it can be done very easily.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,920
Even numbers can be divided by two.

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,020
Odd numbers are not divisible by two.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,489
But you could say we are much more festive
about even numbers too.

6
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,689
If we think about it
that we have to fill up routes,

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,739
then we see that this here.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,659
Is a route.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,760
It is not an even number.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,100
But this is an even number as it is system
if I continue to build on here.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,510
We see that.

12
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:35,650
So long fill up two and two,
so has to do with an even number.

13
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:40,060
Two, four, six, eight
and which continues upwards.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
We sell on one.

15
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:49,020
Then we get an odd number,
so we can generally say

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,150
that an even number is two n and that with N.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,250
Can you take notice of non-conformity to the whole world?

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,310
It may seem with 3 that one is equal to 3.

19
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:01,470
And then you get one twice.

20
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:04,269
Three equals six, which is an even number.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,589
You can try any whole numbers,
so you come.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,029
And if you put it in there like that
will you get an even number, an odd number.

23
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,389
Will we see it one more time?

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,919
That is, an odd number
can be written as 2 than + 1.

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,980
You can try to insert
an even number for than, for example, 2.

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,900
Two times 2 is four + 1, so that's 5.

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,440
If I insert an odd number
3 2 times 3 is 6 + 1.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,580
And that becomes seven, which is an odd number.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,599
But it is not just to add,
for we see here.

30
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,639
We see that here there were two,
four, six, eight plus one.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
We can also think that this here.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,050
Should have been 8.

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,470
Minus this one.

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,410
And that means that an odd number can be written
as two 1 + 1 or 2 N minus 1.

35
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,250
You will find out business
whole number for 1,

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,819
and you will end up with an odd number anyway
if you relate to this

37
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,309
and you end up with an even number
anyway if you stick to this.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,979
The latter is all the more important.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,789
That's what happens
when we add even numbers,

40
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,979
even, odd numbers
and even and odd numbers.

41
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:38,929
If I think that a every even number
can be lit so as to contain two,

42
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,899
i.e. two two pieces,
then take an even number + an even number.

43
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,229
Then we see that this ends up.

44
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,419
As an even number.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,619
In this case, there will be four pieces.

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,050
An odd is an odd number.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
It will be for the vessel.

48
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,179
Plus one. To notify lies
as an odd number to day.

49
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,279
It must then be given as an even number.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Plus a resume is pretty great
that this will be able to collapse

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
and it will be.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
One. Party.

53
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,130
When you need to fill up that ignition here.

54
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,919
Two, four six then odd plus odd.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,619
It will be an even number.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,610
Even + Even becomes even
and it has the buckles.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:02,169
See what happens
if we add even numbers + odd numbers.

58
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:11,559
Now we see that even numbers
stays on the odd even number here.

59
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,919
Plus one.

60
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,609
Even number + odd number becomes odd number.

61
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,709
It should be fine to have with you
about even numbers like that in life,

62
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,660
by the way, without anything but knowing this.

63
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,200
Here that gives itself
is of course huge inefficiency.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,220
It is that if you are going to shorten a fraction,
perhaps the best example

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,690
if we are going to shorten a rather large fraction,
and the uncertainty of what I should share?

66
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,750
Then you will learn everything fraction
that you know prime factorization.

67
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,880
But if you don't have time for parts
for another different reason

68
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,119
don't want to do it like that,
then you can try out possible numbers,

69
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,309
and then you will see checks.

70
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,970
Example Is this number divisible by 2
and the way we look at it.

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,250
It is that
if the number ends in an even number,

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,119
no matter how big it is,
then it is divisible by 2.

73
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,609
So if I have to choose
for example the number 5.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,739
One hundred and thirty-six chosen odd numbers,
odd numbers and then even numbers at the end.

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,140
So this here is perfectly fine.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,889
Divide by two.

77
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,119
What does a fraction have then?

78
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,679
Five hundred and thirty-six.

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,869
Seven hundred and ninety-two parts.

80
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,269
Beds can be made smaller here.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,429
Is also divided in two to see about it
or is it possible at all?

82
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,279
Abbreviated by two.

83
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,850
What can you see?

84
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,679
Baggage numbers are even.

85
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,630
Rear digits are even,
so this one can be halved.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,750
Both can be halved by dividing by two.

87
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,640
Good luck with even odd numbers.
